Sameer is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He previously worked as a post-doctoral associate at MIT and earned his Ph.D. from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. His research interests include Bayesian hierarchical modeling, Bayesian additive regression trees, model selection, and causal inference. Much of his methodological work is motivated by an interest in understanding the long-term health consequences of playing American-style tackle football.
