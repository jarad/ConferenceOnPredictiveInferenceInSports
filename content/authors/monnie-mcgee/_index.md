Dr. Monnie McGee is an Associate Professor in biostatistics and bioinformatics in the Department of Statistical Science at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. She specializes in analysis of high-throughput biological data and is an expert in background correction, normalization, and hypothesis testing for these techniques. She is also interested in sports analytics, particularly analysis of event-based sports like track & field, swimming & diving, and gymnastics.

Currently, she is working on methods for the comparison of equality of components in compositional data across multiple groups. Her service is extensive. She is the current chair of the ASA committee on publications, an associate editor for the Journal of Data Science, Statistics, and Visualization, and the 2025 program chair for the section on statistics in sports.  Dr. McGee holds a B.A. in Mathematics and English from Austin College in Sherman, Texas, and M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in Statistics from Rice University.
